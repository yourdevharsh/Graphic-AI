# Graphic AI ü§ñüé¨

Graphic AI is a web application that transforms text prompts into captivating animations, rendered as mp4videos using the power of generative AI.

## üöÄ How it Works

The project follows a multi-step process to generate videos from your text descriptions:

1. **Prompt Input**: The process begins on the frontend, where a user enters a descriptive prompt for the animation they envision (e.g., "a futuristic cityscape with flying cars").

2. **Backend Request**: The prompt is sent to a Node.js and Express server.

3. **AI-Powered Code Generation**: The server forwards the prompt to the **Google Gemini API**. Gemini, guided by a specialized system prompt, generates a complete, single-file HTML document. This file contains all the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing the **GSAP library** to create the animation.

4. **Headless Browser Rendering**: The server launches a headless instance of Google's **Puppeteer**. It opens the HTML file generated by the AI in a virtual browser window.

5. **Frame-by-Frame Capture**: Puppeteer programmatically takes a series of screenshots of the running animation at a specified frame rate (e.g., 30 frames per second) for a set duration.

6. **Video Compilation**: The captured screenshots are then passed to **Ffmpeg**, a powerful multimedia framework. FFmpeg stitches these individual frames together into a standard MP4 video file.

7. **Display and Download**: The URL of the newly created video is sent back to the frontend, where it is displayed in a video player. The user can then watch and download their generated animation.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Text-to-Animation**: Convert any creative idea into a shareable video.

* **AI-Driven**: Leverages the Google Gemini API for generating high-quality, creative animations.

* **Web-Based Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for easy prompt input and video viewing.

* **Customizable Output**: Video parameters like resolution, duration, and frame rate can be adjusted in the backend code.

* **Downloadable Content**: Easily save your generated animations as MP4 files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js

* **AI**: Google Gemini API

* **Web Automation/Rendering**: Puppeteer

* **Video Processing**: Ffmpeg

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)

* **Animation Library**: GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed (v14 or later is recommended).

* **FFmpeg**: You must have Ffmpeg installed on your system and accessible from the command line. You can download it from the [official FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/graphic-ai.git](https://github.com/your-username/graphic-ai.git)
   cd graphic-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your Google Gemini API key:

   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
   ```

4. **Run the server:**

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

   The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

2. In the text area, describe the animation you want to create. Be as descriptive as possible!

3. Click the "Generate Video" button.

4. Wait for the process to complete. This may take a moment depending on the complexity of the animation and the video duration.

5. The generated video will appear on the page, where you can play it and download it.

## üîß Configuration

You can customize the video output by modifying the constants at the top of the `generateVideoFromHtml` function in the `app.js` file:

* `framesPerSecond`: The frame rate of the output video.

* `captureDurationInSeconds`: The total length of the animation.

* `videoResolution`: The width and height of the video (e.g., `{ width: 1920, height: 1080 }`).

* `screenshotType`: The image format for frames (`png`, `jpeg`, `webp`). `webp` is recommended for quality and file size.
